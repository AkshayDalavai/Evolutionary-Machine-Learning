Optimal Feature Subset Selection for Machine Learning Problems Using Genetic Algorithm

# Project Description
As the world continues to become more connected, diseases spread rapidly, and a challenge arises in selecting the outbreaks which are likely to become severe. Hence predicting the severe outbreaks is essential. In order to predict a model feature selection is crucial as these techniques can be used to identify and remove irrelevant features that do not contribute or decrease the accuracy of the predictive model.
